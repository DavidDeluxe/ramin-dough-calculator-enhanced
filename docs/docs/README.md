# Ramin's Pizza-dough Calculator, reworked by David
A very simple page that makes the calculations you need to make a pizza. 

Page is built using the Bootstrap framework and JQuery, based on Ramin's work.

What's new:
Removed PHP dependency. The calculator now runs entirely in the browser without the need for PHP.
Added a dark-light mode toggle to manually switch between the modes.
Added a wakelock button to keep the screen awake when using the recipe.
Added session system. The current recipe session will be saved to localStorage and will be loaded upon a new visit. There's also a reminder on the index page if there's a session already saved for easy access.
Added a new recipe for a 24-48h BIGA dough.
